The visualization above represents the total political contributions by ZIP code and whether the contribution was made via Check or Card, the two tender types with the largest median and mean amounts. Between the two, ZIP codes with the highest degree of contribution which are unshared appear along Boston's West wing for Check contributions and along the East wing for Credit Card contributions. Discretization was performed along powers of 10, with approximate midpoints along the base 10 scale.  "
